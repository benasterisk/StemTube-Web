# SRS Zoom Timeline Adjustments

## Task List

### 1. Synchronize Timeline with Zoom
- **Objective**: Ensure the timeline reflects the current zoom level.
- **Steps**:
  - [ ] Modify JavaScript to recalculate the visible portion of the timeline based on zoom.
    - Implement logic to dynamically adjust the timeline markers and scale.
  - [ ] Update CSS to allow dynamic adjustment of timeline width.
    - Ensure the timeline container can resize according to the zoom level.
  - [ ] **Delete obsolete code**: Remove any code that becomes unnecessary after implementing new zoom logic.
    - Identify and clean up redundant functions or styles.

### 2. Implement Unified Scrollbar for Waveforms
- **Objective**: Introduce a single scrollbar to control all waveforms horizontally.
- **Steps**:
  - [ ] Update HTML/CSS to add a unified scrollbar under the control area.
    - Design a consistent scrollbar UI that integrates with existing controls.
  - [ ] Implement JavaScript to synchronize waveform scrolling with the unified scrollbar.
    - Develop an event listener to manage scrolling across all waveforms.
  - [ ] **Delete obsolete code**: Remove any individual scrollbar logic that conflicts with the unified approach.
    - Refactor or remove old scrollbar implementations.

### 3. Ensure Full Waveform Visibility
- **Objective**: Allow full visibility of waveforms when zoomed and scrolled.
- **Steps**:
  - [ ] Adjust JavaScript logic to calculate the visible area of the waveform.
    - Ensure that waveforms remain fully visible at all zoom levels.
  - [ ] Ensure scrolling allows full waveform visibility at maximum zoom.
    - Implement smooth scrolling logic to navigate through the waveform.
  - [ ] **Delete obsolete code**: Remove any code that restricts full waveform visibility.
    - Clean up any hardcoded limits or constraints.

## Technical Implementation Details
- **JavaScript**: Use event listeners and DOM manipulation to dynamically adjust the timeline and scrollbar behavior.
- **CSS**: Ensure styles are responsive and adapt to changes in zoom and layout.
- **Testing**: Regularly test each feature to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly. Document test cases and results.

## Verification
- After each task, verify the changes by testing the mixer interface to ensure the desired behavior is achieved.
- Document any additional issues or adjustments needed.
